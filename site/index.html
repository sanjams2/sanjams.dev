    <h4>background</h4>
    <p>My name is James. My (not so anonymous) pseudonym is sanjams.</p>
    <p>
        I like to consider myself an engineer; I'm interested in understanding how things work and solving problems of all shapes and sizes.
        Today, the form of engineering I mostly practice is software engineering. My focus here has mostly been on backend distributed systems, 
        but I have dabbled in many other areas of the stack as well (the lower the better!). I tend to work quickly and ask questions later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am originally from Atlanta. I have lived in Seattle and now reside in New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
        I studied Industrial Engineering and Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a focus in Quality and Statistics and Networking respectively. I graduated in 2017. 
    </p>

        I worked at AWS from 2017 to June 2025. Within AWS, I spent the majority of my time (~6 years) working on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/">AWS SageMaker</a>.
        I spent about four years on the Inference team primarily focusing on the data-plane of the real-time inference system. Some of my projects included 
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-data-capture-endpoint.html">Model I/O Capture</a>, 
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/async-inference.html">Asynchronous Inference</a>,
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html">Serverless Inference</a>,
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/elevating-the-generative-ai-experience-introducing-streaming-support-in-amazon-sagemaker-hosting/">Model Response Streaming</a>, and
        performance optimizations for our services leading to single-digit millisecond latencies. 
        I then spent about two years on the Training team where I primarily focused on building the HyperPod compute platform. My projects included
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod-a-purpose-built-infrastructure-for-distributed-training-at-scale/">Launching HyperPod</a>, 
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-eks-support-in-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod/">Kubernetes support for HyperPod</a>, and leading infrastructure efforts for 
        <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws">Nova Model Training</a>.
        I greatly enjoyed my time at AWS; I am now onto something new...
    </p>
    <p>
        While I have built new things, I generally prefer improving things that already exist.

    <h4>ideas (free!)</h4>
    <p>Hoping to eventually move these to the project section above, but feel free to take it on yourself</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distributed Training Visualizer - a visualization tool that takes model code, model config, and infra config and renders how the job would be mapped across accelerators (using WebGPU!)</li>
        <li>Distributed Training Bandwidth Calculator - a tool for calculating the bandwidth requirements between different accelerators used within a model training run (likely built on top of/with visualizer above)</li>
        <li>Hierarchical All-Reduce - mostly a learning excercise to build a framework for performing all-reduce in a hierarchical fashion</li>
        <li>Claude Code Conversation Explorer - a tool (likely within Claude Code itself) which visualizes Claude Code conversations</li>
        <li>SRE Battle RL Environment - building an RL environment where an agent learning to be an SRE faces off against a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">"chaos-monkey"</a> agent. Reward criteria roughly based on alarms in OK state.
        <li>DSAAS - this ones for me</li>
    </ul>
